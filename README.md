Useful framework for building nontrivial CLI applications.

## Installation & Usage

CDZCLIApplication is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org); to install it simply add the following line to your `Podfile`:

    pod "CDZCLIApplication"

You'll also need to copy the contents of `main.template.m` into your `main.m`, modifying it appropriately.

The best example of usage is probably [ThingsHub](https://github.com/cdzombak/thingshub), from which this framework was extracted.

## Notes

Requires ObjC modules and ARC.
